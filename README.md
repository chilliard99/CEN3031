  Functionality Notes: [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/KIKRzai) (How to run the program)
  In order to get back and front end communication, you need to run both the back and front end service. For the back end, open a terminal and navigate to the web-service-gin folder. Once in there either `make` the makefile or type `go run main.go`. You should see something like in Image (1). Now, go ahead and open up a new terminal and navigate to the helpingHand folder and type `npm run start`. Make sure you have Angular and nodeJS installed, you'll probably have to download some packages before it finishes. You should see something like Image (2). Once you are here you can open up a browser and navigate to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/). You should now see the webpage in (3). Make sure to run npm install the get the required dependencies.
